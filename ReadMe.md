# DataLog Program

### **Project Description**

This project is designed to clean CSV log files generated by Siemens HMI systems, particularly for testing and monitoring PLCs. The program ensures that logs are uniformly structured and accessible for visualization in tools like Grafana. It automates the process of reading raw log files, cleaning them by removing unnecessary data, and serving the cleaned logs via a local server.

This project was developed during my internship at **Premier Tech**, where I used it to streamline the testing and data monitoring of PLCs.

## **Installation Guide**

### 1. Extract the ZIP File or clone into the desired directory

After downloading and extracting the ZIP file or cloning the repository, you'll find several files and directories. Follow the steps below to set everything up properly.

### 2. Download and Install Python 3.12

1. **Open the "pythonDownload" File**:
   - Locate and open the file named **"pythonDownload"**. This will open your default browser and take you to the Python website to download **Python 3.12**.

2. **Install Python 3.12**:
   - Once the Python installer is downloaded, run the installer.
   - **Important**: During installation, make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"**. This ensures Python and `pip` are available from the command line.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open **Command Prompt** (press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter).
   - Type the following commands to ensure Python and `pip` are installed correctly:

     ```bash
     python --version
     pip --version
     ```

   If either command doesn't work, Python may not be correctly added to the PATH. Follow the next step to manually add Python and `pip` to your PATH.

### 3. Manually Add Python and pip to PATH (if needed)

1. **Find the Installation Directory**:
   - Navigate to the Python installation folder, typically located at:
     - `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\`

2. **Open Environment Variables**:
   - Right-click on **This PC** (or **Computer**) and select **Properties**.
   - On the left side, click **Advanced system settings**.
   - In the new window, click **Environment Variables**.

3. **Edit the PATH Variable**:
   - In the **System Variables** section, scroll down and find the **Path** variable, then click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add the following paths (adjust for your Python version):

     - `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\`
     - `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\Scripts\`

4. **Apply and Test**:
   - Click **OK** to save your changes.
   - Open a new **Command Prompt** and test:

     ```bash
     python --version
     pip --version
     ```

---

### 4. Set Up the Project Environment

1. **Open "Install.bat"**:
   - Locate and run the **"Install.bat"** file in the extracted folder.
   - This script will:
     - **Create a virtual environment** using Python's `venv` tool.
     - **Install all required dependencies** from the `requirements.txt` file.

   You will see `pip` downloading and installing packages. Ensure that the process completes without errors.

### 5. Organizing the Log Files

1. **Place Log Files in the Correct Directory**:
   - Place raw log files from the HMI into the `Logs\OriginalLogs` folder.
   - The program will automatically clean these files and output the cleaned logs in the `Logs\CleanedLogs` folder.

---

### 6. Running the Program

1. **Run "Main.py"**:
   - Once everything is set up, run the main program by executing **"Main.py"**.
   - This will start the program and:
     - **Host the current directory** at `http://localhost:8000`.
     - **Automatically clean log files** placed in the `Logs\OriginalLogs` directory.

2. **Access the Hosted Directory**:
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
   - From here, you can access and download files, including cleaned log files, from any machine on your network.

---

### 7. Using Grafana with the Program

1. **Configure Grafana to Access Logs**:
   - In Grafana, set up a **data source** that points to the hosted files at `http://localhost:8000`.
   - Use this URL to access cleaned log files and visualize data directly in Grafana.

---

### 8. Common issues

1. when running `Main.py` for the first time it might give an error about the Log directories, close the program and reopen it, this should resolve the issue.

---

### 9. Updating

If you want to pull (update) the program you can run the `Update.bat` file
